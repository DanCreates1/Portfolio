               Grade 10 student in the IB program with a focus on coding, fitness, and continuous learning. 
               I enjoy building web applications that are practical and easy to use, while developing skills
               in web development through self-directed projects. Outside of coding, I'm training to become
               a certified lifeguard, working out regularly, and exploring new technologies.This portfolio
               highlights ongoing work and progress in both academics and personal development.
